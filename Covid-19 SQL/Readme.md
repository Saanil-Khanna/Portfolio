# COVID-19 Data Exploration

## Description
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing COVID-19 data using SQL. It includes various queries and techniques to extract meaningful insights from the data. The code demonstrates the usage of joins, common table expressions (CTEs), temporary tables, window functions, aggregate functions, and creating views. The goal is to gain insights into COVID-19 cases, deaths, population, vaccinations, and other related metrics.

## Data Source
The COVID-19 data used in this project is sourced from the [COVID-19 Data Explorer](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). This dataset provides comprehensive and up-to-date information on COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide.

## Skills Used
- Joins
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Temporary Tables
- Window Functions
- Aggregate Functions
- Creating Views
- Converting Data Types

## Usage
The provided SQL code consists of several queries that can be executed individually or as a whole. Each query focuses on a specific aspect of COVID-19 data analysis and produces relevant results. You can run these queries in your preferred SQL environment by connecting to the appropriate database and executing the code.

## Instructions
1. Ensure that you have access to the necessary database containing the COVID-19 data.
2. Copy and execute the desired queries in a SQL environment.
3. Review the query results and explore the insights derived from the data.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional queries, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
