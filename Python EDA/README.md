# Data Science Salaries EDA

This repository contains code and a dataset for conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on data science salaries. The analysis includes understanding the dataset, preprocessing the data, generating insights, and visualizing the results. The code is written in Python using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## Objective

The objective of this analysis is to gain insights into data science salaries based on various factors such as job titles, work experience, employment type, company size, remote work ratio, and more. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to understand the distribution of salaries, identify trends, and explore relationships between different variables.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is named 'ds_salaries.csv'. It contains information about data science salaries, including job titles, work experience, employment type, company size, salary in USD, salary currency, employee residence, company location, and more. The dataset has both numerical and categorical columns.

## Code Structure

The code is structured into different sections, each serving a specific purpose in the analysis:

1. Loading the Data: The dataset is loaded from the 'ds_salaries.csv' file into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Understanding the Data: This section includes examining the shape of the dataset, exploring the value counts of certain columns (such as work year, experience level, employment type, etc.), and generating visualizations to gain insights into the dataset.

3. Data Preprocessing: Here, the dataset is checked for missing values and duplicates. Duplicates are dropped to ensure data integrity.

4. Insights and Visualization: This section focuses on generating insights and creating visualizations to understand the relationships between different variables. It includes analyzing salary based on job titles, work experience, employment type, company size, and remote work ratio.

5. Combined Analysis: In this part, combined analysis is performed to explore the relationships between multiple variables. Visualizations are created to analyze the count of employees based on company size and remote ratio, as well as the count of employees based on work year and experience level.

## Usage

To run the code, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries mentioned in the code. You can execute the code in your preferred Python environment or IDE.

Make sure to place the 'ds_salaries.csv' file in the same directory as the code file. Adjust the file path if necessary.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into data science salaries based on different variables. It reveals the average salaries for different job titles, the impact of work experience and employment type on salaries, the relationship between company size and salaries, and the comparison of salaries in the US and other regions. Visualizations are included to support the findings.
