## Abstract

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that has significant impacts on individuals and their families. Extensive research has been conducted to better understand the nature of AD, improve diagnosis methods, and address various research gaps related to prognosis. In this research paper, titled "Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease Patients Using Texture Analysis and Machine Learning" we present a study that focuses on utilizing image processing techniques for the classification of AD and Cognitively Normal (CN) patients.

The objective of our study was to extract textural information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans using the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) as a foundation for texture classification. By analyzing specific regions of interest (ROI) in the MRI dataset, we aimed to decipher the characteristics and patterns associated with AD. Various textural parameters derived from the GLCM were used to understand the unique features of these regions.

We implemented several commonly used image classification algorithms and performed data analysis to determine the most significant features for differentiating between AD and CN patients. The findings of our study revealed a set of features that exhibited high discriminatory power. We compared the performance of different classifiers, including Ensemble, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to identify the most effective method for AD classification.

Additionally, our analysis of the GLCM revealed interesting trends. We observed that as the distance between pixels in the GLCM increased, the classification accuracy decreased. This finding suggests the importance of considering spatial relationships in texture analysis. Moreover, we achieved the best classification results using a specific distance and direction in combination with age and structural data.

The full paper provides detailed insights into our methodology, experimental setup, results, and discussions. We encourage readers to explore the paper to gain a comprehensive understanding of our research findings.
