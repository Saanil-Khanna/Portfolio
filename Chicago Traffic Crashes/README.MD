# Chicago Traffic Crashes Dataset

## Introduction
The Chicago Traffic Crashes dataset provides valuable information about traffic crash reports on city streets within the City of Chicago limits, falling under the jurisdiction of the Chicago Police Department (CPD). The dataset is derived from the electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) maintained by the CPD. It is important to note that any personally identifiable information has been excluded from the dataset to protect privacy.

## Dataset Overview
Due to file size restrictions on GitHub, the original dataset has been split into three individual CSV files:

1. `chicago_traffic_crashes_part_1.csv`: This file contains traffic crash records with a record ID ranging from 1 to 250,000.
2. `chicago_traffic_crashes_part_2.csv`: This file includes traffic crash records with a record ID ranging from 251,000 to 500,000.
3. `chicago_traffic_crashes_part_3.csv`: This file consists of traffic crash records with a record ID ranging from 500,001 to 686,277.

## Dataset Format
Each CSV file follows a similar structure and includes the following columns:

- `Record ID`: A unique identifier for each traffic crash report.
- (Additional columns specific to the dataset): The dataset may contain various columns providing information about the crash, such as the date and time of the incident, location, contributing factors, weather conditions, and involved parties.

The dataset can be used to perform various data analyses related to traffic crashes in Chicago. You can explore questions such as:

- What are the most common contributing factors to traffic crashes?
